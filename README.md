## Hey, I'm Steve

I've worked with different languages and stacks over my career, but for the past 5 years I've been mostly focused on JavaScript and its ecosystem. I care about software architecture, data modeling, and building products that won't need a rewrite in a year. I am a supporter of open-source as a way to build more resilient and better software, and try to contribute whenever I can. You can find more details at https://sradevski.com
