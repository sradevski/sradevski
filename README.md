## Hey, I'm Steve

I've worked with different languages and stacks over my career, but for the past 5 years I've been mostly focused on JavaScript and its ecosystem. I care about software architecture, data modeling, and building products that won't need a rewrite in a year. I try to keep track of what's new in software engineering research and make decisions on empirical evidence as much as possible. You can find more details at https://sradevski.com
